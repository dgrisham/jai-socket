# Jai Socket Library

Basic socket/networking library for Jai. Currently pretty rudimentary, but fills
in some gaps in Jai's standard library. This library may become partially or 
entirely obsolete as Jai's library backfills its networking stuff. In the meantime,
I'm using this for some of my experiments.

Cannibalizing this is highly encouraged.
